##  Design Decisions & Assumptions

- **Modular structure**: Routes, controllers, and models are split for maintainability.
- **Pagination**: Books and reviews support pagination via `page` and `limit` query parameters.
- **Single review per user**: A user can review each book only once.
- **Mongoose validations**: Enforced at model level for data consistency.
- **JWT expiration**: Tokens are valid for 1 day to enhance security.
